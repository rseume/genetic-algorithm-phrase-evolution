# Genetic Algorithm Phrase Evolution

This repository contains a Python implementation of a genetic algorithm to evolve a phrase towards a target phrase. The algorithm uses basic genetic operations like mutation and crossover to optimize the population of candidate phrases.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm**: Uses selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve phrases.
- **Fitness Calculation**: Compares candidate phrases against a target phrase.
- **User Interaction**: Allows user to input the target phrase, population size, and mutation rate.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays the best phrase, its fitness, average fitness, and generation count in the console.
- **Plotting**: Optionally plots the fitness values over generations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- colorama
- tabulate
- matplotlib

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install colorama tabulate matplotlib
